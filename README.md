Introduction to Circular Linked List - GeeksforGeeksA circular linked list is a data structure that stores items in a continuous loop, where the last node points back to the first node. This allows the entire list to be traversed without having to keep track of the end. 
 
Circular linked lists are useful for applications that require circular buffers or circular arrays, and can also be used to implement queues, stacks, or deques. They are more efficient for traversal and operations than linear linked lists. 
 
Here are some characteristics of circular linked lists:
Nodes
Each node contains a pointer to the next node in the list. 
 
Creation
A circular linked list can be created by making the last node of a singly linked list point to the first node. 
Types
There are two types of circular linked lists: singly linked and doubly linked. In a doubly linked circular linked list, each node also has a pointer to the previous node. 
 
Traversal
To check if a linked list is circular, traverse the list using pointers until the fast pointer reaches the end of the list or both pointers meet. If the pointers meet, the linked list is circular.
